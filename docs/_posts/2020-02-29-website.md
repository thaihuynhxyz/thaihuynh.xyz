# [Website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website)
How are we do a website?

### I. Requirements
To do a website we need to have:
- [Web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) contain information as text that is often written by Hypertext 
Markup Language ([HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)) maybe assisted by 
[Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and displayed in a 
[web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser).
- [Domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) to identify a website.
- [Web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) to manage web pages.

### II. Steps
After that we start to do:

#### 1. Prepare web pages
- Simplest you can start with a "Hello world!" text. 
- In case you want to write a blog like this one, I recommend using
[jekyll](https://thaihuynh.xyz/jekyll/update/2020/02/15/welcome-to-jekyll.html).
- Make your own web pages by learning at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
    
#### 2. Buy a domain name
Find some reliable internet domain name registration service as:
- [Google domains](https://domains.google/)
- [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com)
- ...

#### 3. Deploy a web server
a. [Use Web hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) to host a web server.
- Use favorite web servers like [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) or [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
- Build your own web server. I'll update my blog for this way soon.

b. Use static site hosting service as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host static web pages as my own 
[blog](https://thaihuynhxyz.github.io/thaihuynh.xyz).
